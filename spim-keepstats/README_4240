```````````

This is a fork of the most recent code for the spim simulator.
The only additions are to the spim/ folder, which contains
the source code for the terminal interface. A few files have
been added and augmented to keep statistics on the instructions.

=====
BUILD
=====

cd spim
make
sudo make install


(Note: There may be other dependencies, but I think you will at
least need yacc and lex. Be sure to download these packages.)

RUN

spim -keepstats -f file.s
